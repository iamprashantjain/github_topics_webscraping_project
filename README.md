# github_topics_webscraping_project
GitHub is a widely popular platform for hosting and collaborating on code repositories. In this Project I've scraped Information of all Topics along with thier description & Links & Top 3 contributor of each topic with thier Repository Name, Repository link & Stars. At the end created a Excel Workbook which contains each sheet for each Topic & Inside each sheet contains Topic Info such as Contributor Name, Repository Name, Link & Stars.

This is a full fledged project except loading all Topics which requires Selenium to Load all Topics & Save HTML of that Page & Scrape which can be done easily.
